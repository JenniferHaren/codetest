# Code Test: 'Factoid Cards'

Using your favorite Front End and Back End Softwares. Create a 'tinder' style app out of one of your extracurricular interests. In this example, we will use Pokemon, but you are encouraged to use wrestlers, football players, alphabet letters, or any other group of items that has alike members. Please use this as a chance to showcase your personality.

Upon completing this exercise, please post to us:
[ ] A link to the git repository such that we may view your code.
[ ] A link to the URL where we may interact with the finished product

## User Interface

The User Interface should be made out of a MVVM or MVC style frontend technology, using an asynchronous transport technology to talk to your backend.

### UI Requirements

The user interface should present a 'stack' of card like entries containing
[ ] A small picture or icon of the item
[ ] A description of the item
[ ] A fun quote or factoid for the item

Interactions
[ ] The user should be able to swipe the currently presented card away making it disappear and presenting the next card in the stack.

## Backend

The Backend should be node.js with whatever middlewares you'd like to use.

Interactions
[ ] Please provide a RESTful backend for the listing of factoids
[ ] Factoids should be transported to the UI via JSON

### BONUS

As an additional exercise, make it such that a UI user can create their own factoid to be added to the fact stack.
